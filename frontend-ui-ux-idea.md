```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Logo | [Search Jobs, Companies, Reviews...]      | Profile  |

| ----------------------------------------------------------  |
| | Title | Company | Location | Salary | Reviews | Actions | |
| ----------------------------------------------------------  |
| | ...                                                    | |
